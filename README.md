# Introduction to Complex Surveys Workshop
Dr Roxanne Connelly, University of Edinburgh (roxanne.connelly@ed.ac.uk)


We often learn statistical data analysis skills using data which is assumed to arise from a simple random sample of the target population. However, most large-scale multi-purpose social survey data resources use complex sampling strategies. If you are analysing data with a complex sample design, you will need to take this into account in your statistical analyses. This workshop will explain why complex samples are used, the implications of complex samples for statistical data analysis, and approaches to analysing complex samples data. Whilst this workshop is primarily focussed on the analysis of social survey data resources, the principles can be more widely applied to other forms of made and found data. Examples will be provided in Stata and R.

**This workshop assumes an understanding of inferential statistics including regression, and familiarity with Stata or R.**
