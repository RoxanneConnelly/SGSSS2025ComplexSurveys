********************************************************************************

/*	Here are some simple data from a hypothetical complex survey. 
	Let's open it and examine the variables.								*/

* 	The strata variable is called 'strata'

	summarize strata
	
* 	The weight variable we will use is called 'pw'

	summarize pw
	
* 	This dataset also has a finite population correction variable called 'fpc1'	

	summarize fpc1
	
	
	
/* 	Now we declare the survey design.

	Take note of where the primary sampling unit, strata, weight and finite
	population correction variables are specified in this code.				*/
	
	svyset su1 [pweight=pw], strata(strata) fpc(fpc1)
	
	
* 	We can ask Stata to describe the survey design
	
	svydescribe
	
/* 	We can see that there are 3 strata.

	There are three units in each strata.
	
	There is an average of 1,226.6 observations per strata, with a minimum of
	1,152 observations and a maximum of 1,289 observations per strata. 		*/
	

* 	We can calculate the mean of the variable x2 using the code below.

	mean x2
	
/* 	This is the unadjusted mean, we have not yet taken into account the 
	design of the survey.		
	
	To take survey design into account you add the prefix 'svy:' to your
	command.																*/
	
	svy: mean x2

/*	The unadjusted mean is 0.24, the adjusted mean is 0.24.
	Not much difference! But look at the standard error and confidence
	intervals.
	
	The standard error is 0.005 for the unadjusted mean, and 0.02 for the
	adjusted mean.
	
	The standard error is a measure of the precision of the sample mean. The
	larger standard errors have taken into account the uncertainty associated
	with the complex sample.		
	
	At the top of the output you can see the number of strata and the number
	of PSUs. The design df (degrees of freedom) is the number of PSUs minus
	the number of strata (9 - 3 = 6).
	
	The number of observations is the n of the sample, and the population 
	size is an estimate of the population size.							
	
	
	
 	When we calculated the adjusted mean above we took into account the PSUs,
	strata, FPC and weight. 
	
	If we just wanted to weight we could add a weight to the end of our code.
																			*/
	
	mean x2 [pweight=pw]	
	
/*  You can see that the standard error of the mean that is only weighted
	is not as large as that seen when the analysis is fully adjusted.	
	
	When you use svy you are not just 'weighting', you are also taking into
	account clustering and stratification.									*/
	
	
	
	
	
/* 	Lets calculate the full adjusted mean again.

	Note: Stata will remember the survey design you have declared until you 
	declare a new design (i.e. run svyset again). So you don't need to run

**#	SUBPOPULATION ANALYSIS
**
********************************************************************************

/* 	In many analyses you may wish to focus on a sub-population, such as men
	or women, or a specific age group. A standard approach to this would be to
	use the 'if' command (e.g. tab age if (sex==1)), or to drop unwanted cases
	from the data set before carrying out your analysis.
	
	However, if we simply drop cases from the analysis (e.g. using if or drop)
	the standard errors of our estimates cannot be calculated correctly.
	
	Such approaches should therefore be avoided, and instead the 'subpop' 
	command should be used.
	
	When the subpop option is used, only the cases defined are used in the 
	calculation of the estimate but all cases are used in the calculation of
	standard errors. 
	
	
	Let's look at a different data set. The data below are based on the 
	National Maternal and Infant Health Survey (1988) has a stratified design. 
	We need to specify a weight and the stratum.							*/

**#	SOME MORE COMPLEX ISSUES
**
********************************************************************************

/* 	As you have seen above, sometimes Stata commands do not work after svy
	simply because they have not been written to accommodate complex surveys
	(and there is usually an alternative command that can be used).
	
	However, sometimes we cannot provide the exact same statistics in
	unadjusted and adjusted models because the statistics cannot be calculated
	in the same way.
	
	Here we return to the nhanes data, and look at an example using a logistic
	regression model. Note: the issues described below also apply to other models 
	in the Generalized Linear Model family (e.g. ologit, mlogit, poisson).	
	
	For revision of the interpretation of all elements of the logistic 
	regression output see here: 
	https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/stata/output/logistic-regression-analysis/	 */

/* 	Look at how the unadjusted and adjusted results compare.

	The value of the log odds change and the standard errors also change, 
	the standard errors are a little larger in the adjusted analysis.
	
	What else is different between these two outputs?						*/


	

	
	


/*	Look carefully at the top portions of both outputs. You can see the 
	estimation block for the unadjusted model but this is not present in the 
	adjusted model.
	
	The log likelihood values from the estimation block in the unadjusted model 
	are used to calculate the likelihood ratio chi-square test and pseudo R 
	squared statistic, as well as several other model fit statistics.
	
	However we are unable to retrieve log likelihood values with an adjusted
	logistic regression. This is because the complexity of the survey violates
	the assumptions of maximum likelihood estimation, so an alternative
	estimation strategy (pseudo maximum likelihood is used). So the standard 
	model fit statistics cannot be estimated.
	
	Instead of the likelihood ratio chi-square test the adjusted model 
	presents an F-test at the top of the model output. This test tells us the 
	same as the log-likelihood ratio chi2 test. This test tells us whether this 
	model is better at explaining the outcome than the null model (i.e. a model 
	with no explanatory variables).
	
	In this example, F(6, 26) = 52.98, p < 0.001.
	
	If this test were not significant this would tell us that the variables
	you have selected do not do a good job at explaining your outcome variable.
	
	The adjusted model does not print a pseudo R2 value for the adjusted model,
	as this is also calculated from the loglikelihood values.

	You are also unable to calculate model fit statistics such as BIC and AIC 
	with an adjusted model as these also rely on loglikelihood values, 
	see below.																*/

	Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics DOI: 10.1111/anzs.12187

	Some of these measures are implemented in R, but not currently in Stata
	but may be in the future.	
	
	The current standard practice is to calculate your model fit statistics 
	from an unadjusted model as an estimate, and present these alongside your
	adjusted model. 
	
	When you write up your analysis you would want to make clear that these 
	model fit statistics are estimated model fit statistics from the unadjusted 
	models (i.e. add a note to your table saying "McFadden's Pseudo R2, AIC 
	and BIC are estimated from unadjusted models.").						*/
