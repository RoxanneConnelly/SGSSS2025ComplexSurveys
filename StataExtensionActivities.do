	The UKHLS has a very complex sample design with multiple different 
	elements.	
	
	You can read more about the design of the UKHLS here:
	https://tinyurl.com/18nhwo6k
	
	The UKHLS dataset is very complex. There are multiple files that 
	need to be merged together and organised to enable a particular analysis.
	We are using the teaching dataset version of the third wave of UKHLS
	data collection. This is a simplified file which will allow us to 
	focus on the complex sample elements of this data in this activity.

	your computer, see the guidance above.									*/

/*	Here we have told Stata what PSU the sample members are in, what strata 
	they are in, and what weight we want to use.

	There is also an additional element added. The singleunit(scaled) option
	relates to a specific problem that can occur with 'real' complex survey
	data. Where there is a stratum in the data set with a single PSU, Stata 
	is unable to calculate the standard errors of an analysis.
	
	This is because there is insufficient information to compute an 
	estimate of that stratum's variance. Therefore, it is not possible to
	calculate the variance of estimated parameters (i.e. standard errors).
	
	In the UKHLS two Northern Ireland subsamples are simple
	random samples. Therefore these Strata will have a single PSU.
	
	To solve this problem we use the 'singleunit(scaled)' option when we 
	svyset the data. By specifying this Stata uses the average of the 
	variances from Strata with multiple sampling units for each stratum 
	with a singleton PSU.
	
	There are other options that can be used instead of the 'scaled' option,
	inclusing 'missing', 'certainty' and 'centered'. You can read further 
	details	of these in the help file.

**** FURTHER DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES

	There used to be greater limitations to the number of commands that can
	include the svy prefix. But commands for most more advanced data analysis
	techniques can now incorporate survey design adjustments.
	
	These include:
	
	Multiple Imputation
	
	Multilevel Modelling
	
	Panel Data Analysis
	
	Survival Analysis
		
	Structural Equation Modelling
	
	Latent Class Analysis	
	
	The Stata help files will always indicate whether and how svy can be 
	used with a particular data analysis technique.
